        <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>

        <h2> Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how you make unordered lists:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Add a "ul" element (unordered list)</li>
            <li> add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li> They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>

        <p> This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

        <ol>
            <li> Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
            <li> But, the list item elements are the same</li>
            <li> Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase</p>
        <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>
        <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

        <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
