For my web design project, I chose to create a website that would serve as a portfolio for my past experiences. I have been wanting to create a place for all of my past work and experience to be displayed, but was unsure of the format to put it in. When we started this web design unit, I figured that this would be a good display format for my portfolio. I had no experience or exposure to web design or coding before this project, so I was very nervous as to what I could do, but I ended up with a website that I am happy with. 
I have a simple aesthetic when it comes to my work and preferences, so having my website follow a common color scheme and layout fits in with that. Figuring out what layout I wanted my website to have was difficult, mainly because I was struggling to understand how to format my content within Visual Studio Code. I wanted a simple layout with pictures showing each different page of my website. I wanted my section titles such as “About Me” and “Experience” to be clickable images, so I was happy when I changed the landing page to display the pictures as links to my other pages. 
I believe that my website portrays my work in an easy-to-navigate layout and allows viewers to gain a sense of my style. One piece of feedback that I got from all three of my classmates was to change the links and link hover colors to fit in with my color theme. I decided to change my links and link hover colors to the same color as my pages’ background and text colors to fit my website’s style.

Below is my changed link hover color.

For aspirational criteria, I believe that I hit upon some to enhance the flow of my website. I added videos into my web page “social media” to showcase my skills and past social media campaigns. Including video into my website was a particular goal of mine because showcasing my video campaigns from my past internships was an integral part to my experience. The audio is not included due to copyright restrictions. I also made my web pages responsive in order to fit comfortably on different size devices.

Having no experience or knowledge of how to create a website from scratch, I am happy with what I accomplished. If I had more time, I would probably try to add a home button into each of the pages so viewers can easily navigate back to the landing page. I also might want to add more content into each of my pages, since I have more that I would like to showcase. I also struggled with grid layouts and fitting my content into separate places on my webpages, so I would like to take more time to learn about how to do that.
