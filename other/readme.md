Your final project files (html, css, images, etc) should go in here. **One of those files should be called index.html**: it will become your landing page. (Otherwise, your site will land on this readme; probably not what you intended!)

You can then publish this site to the open web: First, go to your repository's Settings and select "Pages" in the margin.

Then change the source from "none" to the "main" branch, and change the folder from "root" to "docs".

(This is a default configuration; note that you could choose other branches, or other folders. But main > docs should work for now!)
