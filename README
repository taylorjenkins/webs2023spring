For my web design project, I decided to create a portfolio website for my past work experiences and projects. I wanted to have a section for my background, education, interests and past projects relating specifically to social media and writing samples. 
Having no experience in web design previous to this project, I found this assignment to be a little bit difficult. I struggled to design my layouts the way I had envisioned, but instead made modifications to accomadate what I had learned. 
For my navigation page, I wanted to have the 4 pictures to portray each of my 4 external pages. I was thinking about putting the links to the external pages on top of the pictures, but I wasn't sure how to do that.
For my external pages, I worked on making them responsive pages/images to fit smaller screens as well as laptops. I also had done a lot of video editing in my past internships, so I worked to include those in my website. (The audio was copyrighted, so they're meant to have no sound).
If you have any suggestions of areas where I can improve, I am happy to hear them!
